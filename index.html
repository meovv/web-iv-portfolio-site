            	<p>My name is Molli Houlihan. I am an ambitious, positive, and dedicated creative. Since a young age my passions have lied in any and all sorts of creative expression. When asked how I became interested in becoming a designer my answer has always started with, “It was a wonderful accident.” Since that wonderful accident, I haven’t looked back. The areas of design that I am most interested in are branding in print, and branding in front end web design.</p>

            	<img src="" alt="research icon">
                	<p>In every case of creating a new design it is incredibly important to do your research. In the case of branding you want to collect any and all information that you can on the business branding, brand identities, and your exact brand your client is aiming for.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                <img src="" alt="brainstorm icon">
                	<p>For me brainstorming starts once all of the information I need is gathered. This consists of mind mapping, sketching, creating moodboards, and looking at various kinds of inspiration. This allows me to gather different perspectives, and evolve ideas into a design that is effective for the client.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                <img src="" alt="concept icon">
                	<p>Concepting involves using all outcomes of research and brainstorming, and then being able to come up with the visual considerations and the message communicated with a design. Creating a solid concept for branding whether it is in web or print is one of the most important steps in my process. Working with client I will be able to finalize the concept, making sure all aspects will be able to engage their target audience.</p>

                <div>
                <img src="" alt="creating icon">
                	<p>This is when I will take any thumbs and comps that I have created and pull them together to create a final design. This is one of the most exciting parts of my design process as I’m able to take a web or brand design to a place that gives a client the identity that they’ve always wanted to communicate to their audience.</p>
